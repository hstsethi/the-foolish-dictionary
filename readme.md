"The Foolish Dictionary" by Gideon Wurdz is a whimsical collection of humorous definitions and playful reflections on the English language, likely written in the early 20th century. This light-hearted work parodies traditional dictionaries by offering comically absurd definitions for a variety of words, mixing wit with satire to entertain readers.
