"The Foolish Dictionary" by Gideon Wurdz is a whimsical collection of humorous definitions and playful reflections on the English language, likely written in the early 20th century. This light-hearted work parodies traditional dictionaries by offering comically absurd definitions for a variety of words, mixing wit with satire to entertain readers. 

This project is based on HTML, plain text version of The Foolish Dictionary provided by [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1989). The goal of this project is to provide a machine readable version of it.

Currently, the JSON version, list of terms and the scripts used to create such is available. 

## TODO

- Convert it to other versions including Stardict.

- Create a program that will query the JSON document to return it's associated definition.
